    <div><p>Multinational companies are becoming increasingly common in developing countries.  Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?
            More and more multinational corporations are being established in less developed countries. The advantages and disadvantages of this will be outlined here and the argument made that this is a negative trend overall. 
            There are a number of advantages to multinationals locating in poorer countries. First, this creates jobs in those countries. This helps both the economical of those countries in general as well as individuals through providing employment. A second benefit is that goods can be producing more cheap. It follows that they can therefore be sold more cheaply too in the global market.
            In contrast, the disadvantages include the following. Workers in poorer countries are easily exploited. Unscrupulous employers can and do provide very low wages while benefit from long hours worked in return. Furthermore, large factory produce a considerable amount of pollution. As a result, less well off countries have the added burden of increased environment problems.
            The claim here is that there are more disadvantages than advantages with regards to this issue. In addition to the drawbacks mentioned above another key problem concerns the effect on developed countries. Many factories in the US and Britain for example have located to developing countries. In consequence, considerable employment now exists in many areas in these countries where factories were previously locating.
            In conclusion, although there are clearly pros and cons to multinationals expand into poorer nations. However, the disadvantages outweigh the advantages overall. The negative effects of this development can be seen not only in the developing nations, but also in the developed countries.Multinational companies are becoming increasingly common in developing countries.
